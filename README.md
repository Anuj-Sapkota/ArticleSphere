Notes for Instructors

The commit history on the main branch reflects our collaborative work. You can use git log or GitHubâ€™s commit history to see individual contributions.

We created the stable-clean branch to provide a clean, working version of the project for submission, as main contains some errors due to earlier Git operations (e.g., scattered project structure, deleted .classpath).
